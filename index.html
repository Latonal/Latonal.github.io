                                        <p>Objective that I had already set myself when I was younger, a customizable homepage, currently still in development but the first version if already accessible with the most basic features available.</p>
                                        <p>A project that seems simple but a very heavy code aimed at being optimized, both in terms of its length and on the side of your browser. My ambition was to make a light site in order to oppose the sites that were much too heavy even at their generation, which is today a standard that is far too present.</p>
                                        <p>Made with HTML/CSS and vanilla Javascript (without library). For the database, I used IndexedDB which is a database saving the informations in your browser itself, so there is no cost on my side and close to no impact on yours given that the memory space required is negligible.</p>
                                        <p>This first version was quite a big challenge, and much more is to come: page system, addition of customization of icons, facilitation to modify part of the CSS...</p>

                                        <p>So I had to allow them to use both the CRM of WMKI and the Wordpress CMS in order to feed the site.</p>
                                        <p>I was faced with the creation of an interactive map with the Google API, and the management of points of interest from various content source.</p>
                                        <p>However, Google's API is not the only map available on the site, and I had to allow searching by region via a simpler map.</p>
                                        <p>I also had to dynamize the articles available for each of these points of interest (and more), as well as the articles in the \"new\" section, and I helped repair some of the simulators available on the site.</p>
